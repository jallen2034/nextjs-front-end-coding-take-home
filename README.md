# Front-End JavaScript Coding Challenge

### Message from Jacob:

The original repository for this take-home project utilized Create-React-App, which has been deprecated by the core React team. As a result, 
I opted to build this project using Next.js, MUI, and TypeScriptâ€”a more modern stack that aligns closer with my professional experience.

This choice not only allows for improved performance and SEO through server-side rendering, but also provides access to the powerful 
App Router features introduced in Next.js 13. These enhancements facilitate a more efficient data-fetching strategy 
and a seamless user experience in my opinion.

## The Challenge:

I have created an application that serves as a boilerplate for a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project, initialized using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The repository includes a `/src/data` directory containing a simplified dataset of MLS real estate transactions in Vancouver.

### Requirements:

- Utilize the provided resale data in `/src/data` (sample Vancouver resale data from 2023, excluding single-family homes).
- Integrate a mapping library to visualize the data on a map. We recommend using [Google Maps](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform) or [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), as our data product leverages Mapbox.
- Create a user interface that enables users to interact with, filter, and explore the data.
- Make regular, meaningful commits that clearly reflect the logical progression of your work.

### Getting Started:

#### Installation:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/project.git
 cd project
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

#### Mapbox API Key Setup:

In order to use the mapping functionality, you need to set up your Mapbox API key. Follow these steps:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
2. Add your Mapbox API key in the `.env` file like this:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_KEY=*your_mapbox_api_key_here*
```
3. The API key will be automatically read from the .env file in the project. 
The key is accessed in the code from apiUtils.ts in the /app folder:

```typescript
const MAPBOX_API_SECRET_KEY: string = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_KEY || '';

export {
  MAPBOX_API_SECRET_KEY
};
```

### Running the Development Server:
Once your API key is configured, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Running a Production Build:
For optimal application performance, I recommended to run the app in production mode. Follow these steps to build and start the app for production:

1. **Build the application**:    Use the following command to create a production-optimized build of the application:
```bash
npm run build
````
This should  generate a `build` directory with optimized assets, including minified JavaScript, CSS, and other files.
2. Start the production build: After building the app, you can start the production server with:

```bash
npm start
```

This will serve the optimized build on your local server, ensuring that the app performs at its best.
- Performance: Running the app in production mode significantly improves load times, performance, and overall user experience.
- Environment: Before doing this, be sure to double check that your environment variables (if any) are correctly configured for the production environment.

### Running the Automated Unit Test Suite with Jest:
To run the unit tests using Jest, use the following command in your terminal:
```bash
npm test
```
This will execute all the unit tests in the project. Upon successful execution, you should see an output similar to the following:

```bash
PASS  src/app/shared-components/property-list/helpers.test.ts (8.478 s)
PASS  src/app/shared-components/filter-data-modal/helpers.test.ts (8.601 s)
PASS  src/app/shared-components/react-mapbox/helper.test.ts (8.777 s)

Test Suites: 3 passed, 3 total
Tests:       18 passed, 18 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        9.477 s
Ran all test suites.
```
- Test Suites: The number of test files that were executed and passed.
- Tests: The total number of individual test cases that were executed.
- Time: The total amount of time it took to run the automated test suite.

### Building for Production:
To build the app for production:
```bash
npm run build
```
