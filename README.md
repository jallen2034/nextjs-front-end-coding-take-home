# Front-End JavaScript Coding Challenge

### Message from Jacob:

The original repository for this take-home project utilized Create-React-App, which has been deprecated by the core React team. As a result, 
I opted to build this project using Next.js, MUI, and TypeScriptâ€”a more modern stack that aligns closer with my professional experience.

This choice not only allows for improved performance and SEO through server-side rendering, but also provides access to the powerful 
App Router features introduced in Next.js 13. These enhancements facilitate a more efficient data-fetching strategy 
and a seamless user experience in my opinion.

## The Challenge

I have created an application that serves as a boilerplate for a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project, initialized using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The repository includes a `/src/data` directory containing a simplified dataset of MLS real estate transactions in Vancouver.

### Requirements

- Utilize the provided resale data in `/src/data` (sample Vancouver resale data from 2023, excluding single-family homes).
- Integrate a mapping library to visualize the data on a map. We recommend using [Google Maps](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform) or [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), as our data product leverages Mapbox.
- Create a user interface that enables users to interact with, filter, and explore the data.
- Make regular, meaningful commits that clearly reflect the logical progression of your work.

### Getting Started

To launch the development server, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
